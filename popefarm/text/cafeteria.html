<h3>Cafeteria and Social Stairs</h3>
<p>At Pope Farm Elementary School, we prioritize both nutritious meals and immersive experiences for our students. During mealtime, students can enjoy a panoramic 360-view of our school from our cafeteria space while savoring their meal.</p>

<p>The social stairs and mural located near the cafeteria also serve as a reminder of the inclusive environment that we foster at Pope Farm Elementary. These stairs are not only used for school assemblies and events but are also a popular gathering spot for grade-level activities, promoting a sense of community among our students.
