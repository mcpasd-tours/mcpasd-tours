<p>Welcome to Pope Farm Elementary School, the home of the Prairie Dogs! Since opening in the 2020-21 school year, we have been dedicated to providing a warm and inviting environment for learning. </p>

<p>Each grade level at our school is uniquely themed around a plant or animal, which can be explored and studied in the adjacent Pope Farm Conservancy. Come and visit our modern school, where we foster a vibrant atmosphere that inspires creativity, critical thinking, and collaborative learning.</p>
