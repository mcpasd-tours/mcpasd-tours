<h3>Lower Playground</h3>
<p>Welcome to our newly installed lower playground! We are incredibly grateful to our generous community and PTA for their support in funding this exciting addition to our school. Designed with the utmost care and consideration, our lower playground offers a safe and engaging space for our students to explore, play, and let their imaginations soar. </p>
