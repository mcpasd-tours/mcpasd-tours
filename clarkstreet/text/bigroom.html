<h3>The Big Room</h3>
<p>This big room is easily convertible to accommodate groups of all sizes for a variety of needs. Clark Street uses this space for ‘all school’ meetings, two separate classrooms, breaking groups into smaller groups, etc. </p>
<p>The room dividers have whiteboard surfaces that allow our learners to make their thinking visible and to express their creativity.</p>
<p>The breakout spaces throughout our school are useful for students who prefer quieter spaces, or need to work with a teacher while everyone else is working quietly.  The flexible and easily movable furniture in all of our spaces help us quickly redesign the room to best accommodate the learning needs.</p>
