<h3>Kitchen</h3>
<p>The kitchen space is not only a convenient tool, but also a valuable learning space.</p>
<p>Whether students and staff are preparing food harvested from the Clark Street garden; learning about cultures, histories, and traditions through food; or creating the social conditions for deeper learning, they understand that design matters.</p>
<p>Combined with the commons area, these spaces are designed to support creativity, which truly supports the cultivation of a community of engaged learners.</p>
