<h3>Science Classroom</h3>
<p>Magic happens when learning and doing are combined to support student engagement.  Rockets are created, zombie pathogens are imagined, advanced research topics are pursued, and art is reimagined through the lens of chemistry.</p>
<p>Passionate arguments around the topics of energy, climate change, food security, and technology echo what is happening across the nation around the dinner table,  in college auditoriums, and even the halls of Congress.</p>
<p>Car crashes reveal their secrets, plants are treated as teachers,  and students participate in roundtable discussions about where science, ethics, and culture intersect.</p>
<p>This room is where science, as an integral part of our lives, is explored, measured, analyzed, debated, and connected to our communities.</p>
