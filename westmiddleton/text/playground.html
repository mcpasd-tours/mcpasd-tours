<h3>Playground</h3>
<p>Welcome to the newly constructed playground at West Middleton Elementary School!</p>
<p>This fantastic playground was made possible with funds from the 2022 'Wolverine Dash' as well as contributions from the school and district.</p>
<p>The project was designed with all students in mind. It includes various adaptive features, such as a wheelchair-friendly 'wolverine market' play structure, a rubber surface path leading to the playground, and even musical instruments for everyone to enjoy.
