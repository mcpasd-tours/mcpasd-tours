<h3>Makerspace</h3>
<p>The Maker Space at Middleton High School is a collaborative environment where students, teachers, and community members can come together to incubate ideas, innovate, problem-solve, and think critically. Equipped with a wide range of tools and materials such as sewing machines, robotics, and arts and crafts supplies, the space provides opportunities for students to explore textiles, electronics, art, and more.</p>
<p>It fosters a supportive and empowering environment where individuals can create and share their talents or simply explore new ideas. The space is currently home to a vibrant 'maker space club' where students eagerly play, make, learn, and facilitate lessons.</p>
