<h3>Black Box Theater</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Black Box Theater! This versatile space has been utilized for a variety of classes including Orchestra, Theatre, English, and Hip-Hop. It has also hosted numerous Middleton High School Theatre productions, student recitals, and the Middleton Players Theater Production. With its intimate scale, the theater allows for a closer connection with the audience, giving students the opportunity to fully bring their craft and stories to life. The Black Box space has a state of the art lighting system that allows for students interested in theater technology and production to work with the same technology they would find on Broadway or West End!</p>
<p>The availability of additional spaces also allows for more time for students to work on detailed technical designs and become more proficient in using all the features of the Black Box Theater.
