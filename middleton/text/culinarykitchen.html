<h3>Culinary Kitchen</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Culinary Kitchen!</p>
<p>Here, we provide professional-style kitchen spaces for students to learn valuable skills across various disciplines such as culinary arts, nutrition, and childcare. Whether you're aspiring to become a chef, nutritionist or childcare teacher, there is something for everyone in our department. </p>
<p>We are excited to introduce several new courses, including a baking and pastry class, where the baked goods created by students will be used for students to enjoy in the school cafeteria. </p>
<p>We have also collaborated with the social studies department to create a new course titled 'Culture and Cuisine.' Did you know that the FCS Department has helped 164 students obtain their ACCT [Assistant Childcare Teacher] certificates? This allows students the opportunity to begin a career in the childcare field.
