<h3>Stairwell Mural</h3>
<p>The mural funded by our parent-teacher organization depicts students playing outside, surrounded by positive words. It represents our school's commitment to inclusivity and aims to reinforce to all students that they are valued members of our community and capable of greatness. Our hope is that this inspiring piece of art will be a daily reminder of belonging and positivity for all who see it.</p>
