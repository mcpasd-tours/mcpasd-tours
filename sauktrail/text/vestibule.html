<h3>Front Office/Vestibule </h3>
<p>Welcome to our building! As you step inside, you are in our vestibule area, which visitors enter once buzzed in through the front entrance.</p>
<p>These doors provide access to either the front office or the school, and we have implemented several security measures to prioritize the safety and well-being of all staff, students, and visitors.</p>
<p>Our visitor management system is one of these measures, requiring everyone to sign in and receive a visitor badge. This system helps us maintain a record of who is in the building at any given time, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access specific areas.</p>
