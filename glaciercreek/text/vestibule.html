<h3>Vestibule/Mural</h3>
<p>Step into our vestibule and get ready to be greeted by a world of diverse cultures. As you enter through the main door, your eyes will be drawn to a vibrant mural. This stunning artwork, created by one of our talented district staff members, showcases the word "hello" in 50 different languages. It serves as a beautiful reminder of the global community that thrives within Glacier Creek Middle School. Prepare to embark on a journey of multicultural exploration as you immerse yourself in the warmth and diversity our school proudly embraces.</p>
