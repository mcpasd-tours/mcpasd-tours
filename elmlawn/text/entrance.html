<p>Welcome to Elm Lawn Elementary, Home of the Eagles!</p>

<p>Immerse yourself in the rich history of our school. Back in 1913, the very first Elm Lawn Elementary School was set up right where the district office stands today. It got its name from the breathtaking abundance of majestic elm trees that surrounded the area. Fast forward to 1987, and the current Elm Lawn Elementary School proudly stands on Woodgate Rd.</p> 

<p>At Elm Lawn, we prioritize inclusivity and warmly welcome everyone through our doors!
