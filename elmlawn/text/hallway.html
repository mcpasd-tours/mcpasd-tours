<h3>Main Hallway</h3>
<p>Welcome to our vibrant main hallway, where the Elm Lawn theme of "All Together Now!" takes center stage. As you journey along this captivating corridor, be sure to pause at its grand finale: the magnificent display of the Elm Lawn Eagle, flaunting its fantastic feathers.</p>

<p>Each classroom at Elm Lawn has the opportunity to earn feathers by embodying our cherished Elm Lawn Eagle Pride and exemplifying our Eagle Expectations. Here, the power of fantastic feathers unites us all, forging a strong sense of community and togetherness that is the heartbeat of Elm Lawn.</p>
