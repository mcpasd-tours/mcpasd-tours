<h3>Blacktop Playground</h3>
<p>The blacktop playground at Elm Lawn Elementary School is a bustling area where students can indulge in various physical activities and embrace their playful side. It offers a designated space for basketball enthusiasts to showcase their skills and engage in friendly matches. The blacktop surface also serves a dual purpose as a learning tool by featuring a painted map of the 50 US states, allowing students to deepen their knowledge of geography while they play.</p>
