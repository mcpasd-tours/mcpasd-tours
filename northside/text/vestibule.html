<h3>Front Office and Vestibule</h3>
<p>Welcome to the front office at Northside Elementary, a place where our friendly admin assistants are dedicated to helping you with all your needs. It's interesting to note that this office has a unique history - it was originally the Art Room before the district made the necessary addition of secure entry ways. As you enter, be sure to take a moment to appreciate the beautiful tree located in the office. This tree was actually crafted by students and staff, with the guidance of a talented artist from our community, approximately 10 years ago.</p>
