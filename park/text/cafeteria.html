<h3>Cafetorium</h3>
<p>The Cafe at Park Elementary has a beautiful view of the natural landscape of the Driftless Area around Cross Plains, WI. The state-of-the-art cafe was part of the 2018 referendum project. In this space there is a cafeteria, a media center with a dropdown screen, and sound systems for engaging family events like our Encore night. It has a kitchen, providing a fresh dining experience for students and staff. Additionally, the Cafe is a versatile gathering area designed to accommodate groups of all sizes.</p>
